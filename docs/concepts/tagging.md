# Tagging
Datasets, tasks, runs and flows can be assigned tags, either via the web
interface or the API. These tags can be used to search and annotate datasets, or simply to better organize your own datasets and experiments.

For example, the tag <a
href="https://www.openml.org/search?type=task&sort=runs&tags.tag=OpenML-CC18" target="_blank">OpenML-CC18</a> refers to all tasks included in the OpenML-CC18 benchmarkign suite.
