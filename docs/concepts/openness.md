# Openness and Authentication
You can download and inspect all datasets, tasks, flows and runs through the
website or the API without creating an account. However, if you want to upload
datasets or experiments, you need to <a href="https://www.openml.org/auth/sign-up" target="_blank">create an account</a>, sign in, and find your API key on your profile page.

This key can then be used with any of the [OpenML APIs](APIs).
