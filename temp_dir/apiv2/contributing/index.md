# Contributing

Like many other open source projects, contributions from the community are an essential
piece in making OpenML successful. We very much appreciate that you want to make a
contribution. To try to make this as smooth as possible for everyone involved,
we wrote this contribution guide. There are many kinds of contributions, such as
bug reports, participating in discussions, making code contributions, or updating
documentation.

### Bug reports

When you encounter an issue using or deploying the Python-based REST API, the first step
is to search our [issue tracker](https://github.com/openml/server-api/issues) to see if others
have already reported the issue. If this is the case, please indicate that you encountered
the issue by leaving a :+1: on the issue. Feel free to leave a comment if you have
additional information that may be useful to track down or fix the bug.

If the bug has not been reported before, please open a new issue to report it.
When you open a bug report, please include:

 - a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example),
 - a description of the expected behavior,
 - a description of the encountered behavior,
 - and any additional information that you think may be relevant, such as which environment you encountered it in, or when you first encountered the bug.

### Code

If you want to make code contributions, please first make sure there is an open issue
that describes what the contribution should look like. This may be a proposal that you
write yourself, or an existing open issue that you want to help us with. Please indicate
on that issue that you would like to contribute to it. This way, we can ensure that
everything is clear, it's not out of date, and "officially" assign you to the issue so
that others know its being worked on. Making sure there is a clear description and clear
assignment helps prevent a situation where someone makes a large contribution that is
unwanted, or is simultaneously developed by someone else. With an issue assigned,
please head over to the "[Development](contributing.md)" section.

### Documentation

For minor fixes, it's fine to make the changes and submit them through a pull request.
For larger changes, please make sure you are assigned to an issue first as is described
in the "[Code](#code)" section of this page. Then, visit the "[Documentation](documentation.md)"
page to learn how to contribute documentation changes.
